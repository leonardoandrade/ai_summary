# AI Summary README Generator

AI Summary is a code project that utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate README files for code projects. The program scans a given directory, reads file contents, and generates a prompt that is then passed to an AI model to produce a human-like summary of the project.

## Features 🚀

- Scans directories and reads file contents, including binary file detection.
- Generates prompts based on file contents and recent Git commit messages.
- Utilizes OpenAI's GPT models to generate summaries.
- Provides a CLI for easy usage and integration into development workflows.
- Supports changelog generation based on recent Git commits.

## Usage 🛠️

To use AI Summary, set the `OPEN_AI_KEY` environment variable with your OpenAI API key. Then, run `main.py` with the following arguments:

- `directory`: The directory containing the files to process.
- `target_file`: The target README.md file to generate.
- Optional flags:
  - `--generate-changelog`: To include a changelog in the README (default: True).
  - `--model`: To specify the AI model (default: gpt-4-1106-preview).

Example:

```
python main.py ./project-directory ./README.md --generate-changelog --model gpt-4-1106-preview
```

## Requirements 📋

The project requires several Python packages to run, which can be installed using the `requirements.txt` file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Latest Changes 🔄

- Added the ability to pass the AI model as a command-line option.
- Fixed formatting issues with the README generation.
- Updated tests to reflect the latest changes.

## TODOS 📝

- Add support for target README size.
- Enhance error handling and logging for better debugging.
- Implement additional features based on user feedback.
