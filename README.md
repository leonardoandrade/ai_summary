# Code Project README

This README file provides an overview of the code project and its structure. It does not include the actual content of the files.

## Project Description

The code project is designed to generate a README file in markdown format using the Large Language Model (LLM). It takes a directory containing files as input and generates a README.md file based on the content of those files.

## Usage

To use the code project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. Run the `main.py` script with the following command:

```
python main.py <directory> <target_file> [--generate-changelog]
```

Replace `<directory>` with the path to the directory containing the files you want to process, and `<target_file>` with the path to the README.md file you want to generate. The optional `--generate-changelog` flag indicates whether to generate a changelog (default: True).

## File Structure

The code project consists of the following files:

- `main.py`: The main script that generates the README.md file.
- `README.md`: The README file for the code project (not to be listed in the generated README).
- `requirements.txt`: A list of required dependencies for the code project.
- `.gitignore`: A file specifying which files and directories to ignore in version control.
- `files_reader/files_reader.py`: A module that reads the content of files in a directory.
- `files_reader/directory_scanner.py`: A module that scans a directory for files.
- `test/__init__.py`: An initialization file for the test directory.
- `test/files_reader_test.py`: Unit tests for the `files_reader` module.
- `test/open_ai_client_test.py`: Unit tests for the `open_ai_client` module.
- `test/directory_scanner_test.py`: Unit tests for the `directory_scanner` module.

## TODOS âœ…

- Add support for target README size.
- Generate changelog (in progress).
