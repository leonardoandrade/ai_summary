# AI Summary Code Project README

Welcome to the AI Summary Code Project! This innovative tool leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate README files for code projects. Our README below will guide you through the project's purpose, how to use it, and the current development progress.

## Project Description üìñ

AI Summary Code Project is designed to streamline the creation of README files for software repositories. By scanning the specified directory and processing the files, it uses an LLM to craft a comprehensive README. The goal is to provide a high-level overview of the project that is both informative and accessible to users and potential contributors, without delving into code specifics or file listings.

## Usage üöÄ

To use the AI Summary Code Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Install the required dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set your OpenAI API key in the `OPEN_AI_KEY` environment variable.
4. Run the `main.py` script with the necessary arguments:

```bash
python main.py <directory> <target_file> [--generate-changelog]
```

- `<directory>`: The directory path containing the files to be summarized.
- `<target_file>`: The path where the generated README.md will be saved.
- `--generate-changelog`: Optionally generate a changelog (enabled by default).

The script will create a README.md file at the specified `target_file` location.

## Current Progress and TODOs üõ†Ô∏è

- [ ] Implement customization options for README output size.
- [ ] Add functionality for changelog generation.
- [ ] Improve the LLM integration for better performance and accuracy.

This project is actively being developed, and we encourage contributions from the community.
