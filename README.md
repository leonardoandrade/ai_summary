# AI Summary README Generator

This project provides a tool for generating README files using the power of a Large Language Model (LLM). It scans a directory of code files, reads their contents, and uses an AI model to create a comprehensive README without listing filenames or describing code directly.

## Features 🌟

- Scans a specified directory for code files.
- Reads file contents, handling both text and binary files.
- Generates a README file based on the content of the files using a Large Language Model.
- Optionally generates a changelog.
- Handles environment variables for API keys.
- Provides a command-line interface for easy use.

## Installation 📦

To use this tool, clone the repository and install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt` using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage 🛠️

To generate a README, run the `main.py` script with the directory and target README file as arguments:

```
python main.py <directory_path> <target_readme_file>
```

You can also specify whether to generate a changelog with the `--generate-changelog` flag.

## Configuration ⚙️

Before running the script, ensure the `OPEN_AI_KEY` environment variable is set with your OpenAI API key:

```
export OPEN_AI_KEY='your_openai_api_key_here'
```

## Testing 🧪

Unit tests for the file reader, directory scanner, and OpenAI client are provided in the `test` directory. Run these tests using `pytest` to ensure functionality.

## TODOs 📝

- Add support for target README size customization.
- Implement changelog generation functionality.

## Contributing 🤝

Contributions to improve the tool or extend its capabilities are welcome. Please follow standard pull request processes.
